    <th><h3 class="Intro"><p>Hello, My name is Arturo Sebastian Huerta and my main career goal is to become a Chef. My main career plan is to finish up highschool and after that 
    I plan to go to most likely eithre riverside county college or COD for two years and then transfer to ICE (Institute of Coulinary Education) where ill finish up and start my 
    career as a chef. Out of all the career choices I viewed this one is the only one that cought my honest attention, seemed fun, and I can mold a lot
    of things with it.</p>
   
    <p>I have a few creative ideas, which would be really useful for this career allowing me to be able to make plenty of dishes. This can be shown trough some of the things 
    Ive done in the past such as back in 7th grade I used to take cooking classes in middle school, for out final we had to bake a cake and I ended up getting third place being 
    the only one man team while the people that got first was a four man and second place was a two man, also getting first price for most colorful cake. More of my
    is shown with music. Because of my semi musical talent I can do some ok stuff with it and probably manage to grow somethings with it.</p>
    
    <p>Being in the school marching band has really helped me become more open with my teamwork and also has helped my social skills a lot. I have done both marching and front 
    ensemble so I have learned to work with plenty of different people. I don't have a lot of work experience but I have some vollunteer experience. I have vollunteer in a few 
    places helped with some activities back in middle school and most recently vollunteered at comic con in palm springs.</p>
    
   
    <p>In the end I don't really plan to do a lot with coding but it is a good thing that seems fun and easy to learn, thank you for reading my page take another look around.</p>
