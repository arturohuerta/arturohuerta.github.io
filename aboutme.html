    <th><h3 class="Intro">Hello, my name is Arturo Sebastian Huerta, and im an 3pic gamer who hates sans. I play some instruments like trombone. I like to play things like forkknife, undertale, and beating up sans. I really hate sans. But being honest I like to normally spend my time playing things like Paladins, Insurgency and TF2 with a few of my friends.
    Im in the marching band and also in a still unamed Garage Band. When I play by myself In normally play games like Warframe, Fallout New Vegas, and Splatoon 2. Other of my hobies are Bird Watching, playing instruments and sometimes cook. Anyways thats about it gamers, thank you. </h3></th>
