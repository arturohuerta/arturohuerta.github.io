  <p class="Story">Starting story: So. snas is sitting at home on a saturday night, watching South Park, when his cable suddenly cuts out. The TV goes out which then Snas begins flipping through channels, and finds that every other channel is cut out. Irritated by this he walks outside to see a very thicc being in the distance, destroying cable towers. Snas makes his way to find someone to help him. He sees an acquaintance, Tike Myson, eating a sweet burger. Snas makes his way to Tike, and Tike explains to Snas what the being in the distance is exactly, and the power it holds. Snas asks Tike Myson to come with him, and Tike agrees. He chomps down his sweet burger in one bite and goes with snas. And then Snas and Tike got to fight Norbit. The fight is intense, in the end Norbit falls however with his one last breath he blasts Snas, Tike quickly pushes him out of the way. Tike falls and looks up at Snas using his last breaths to tell him to pay his tab with Grillbyâ€™s, and that he wished he had spent more time with the kids. The End.

  <p class="Written">When me and my partner made this we figured we wanted something halarious, and comedic. We used the first things that came to our minds
  like thanos, Sans Undertale and Mike Tyson. A few of our problems that were encountered while we made this was mostly with the looping. After a choise it 
  just kept looping us back into the same question. We managed to fix this by reconecting our states, which connect to our second problem which was why, we
  kept looking trough and we could not figure it out until we saw that we had to put it in a global state. After that it was really smooth sailing being pretty easy.
  We first made all the endings giving them a name so later on we could be able to easily connect them. After we finished that we made everything connect, with the 
  choises to every ending. Over all I found out this was a really fun project.</p>

<p class="Narrartion">In our code our main features are the choices that the player has to make in order to get one of the main five endings. We started of with 
extremely simple things like Y for yes and N for no. However after a while we decided to have a different set of choices, these being attack or reason. There are
multiple times there come into effect like when the player first meets Bernort, or John Wack. Another command we had was figuring out how to start over. Everytime 
a player gets to an ending they get brought back to the beginig shown in the video when the player gets the bad ending, or not epic ending. This lets the player jump
right back into the game with nothing to bother them.</p>
