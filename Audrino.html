  <p class="VResponce">As you can see on our video we have a buzzer that connects with buzzers to make the lights blink with the music. We made our LCD's and Buzzers set on different pins but what brings it to light up together is
  how we wrote our code.</p></div>

  <p class="Written">Me and my partner Rylee have made our project based on LCD's that will light up with a buzzer. This Idea came to us while we were messing with the buzzer and wo found it would be both fun and easy.
  Our project had two main parts, the audrino board and the code and overall what gave us trouble was the code. Connecting the Buzzer to play with the music was pretty easy, we ended up connecting three buzzers to our
  board simply because we could. The lights were easy, we started with three and then five but we decided to go all out and just put seven lights on. All our lights and wires are blue, white and black this was to reflect
  on the music being the theme of the character called Sans "Fortnite" The Skeleton, who wears a blue jacket and is a skeleton like the fortnite skin called "Skull Trooper" where his inspiration came from. Then came the code:
  because me and Rylee don't have much idea on how to make the acctual music we copied code from online and it was a smooth ride until we couldn't connect both the lights and the buzzer to the music, we solved this by just
  setting the LCD's and buzzer to the same pin. Of course this gave us even more problems because the lights became extremely dim. We thought we should just leave it like this but I said no and set out to fix this. We started
  by messing with the wires; we messed with the pins and where everything was located, even asked someone to help but in the end they just told us we were doing it all wrong pulled out most of our wires and left leaving us to 
  fix it again. We were delayed a day becuase of thsi but when it was fixed we managed to put everything back and then I looked at the code. Then it was simple: all we had to do was to set the music to also play with the buzzer. 
  I began to play with the code looking at what would work and all I did was in void setup I had two sections of code, one for the buzzer and another with the LCD's. In the LCD's there was a lot of code that wouldn't work becuase
  I was kind of like I would a buzzer trying to make it play sound but soon enough I did what was needed and finished our project in a good way. <a href="Audrino.ino" download="Audrino.ino">Here is the Code that we used</a></p></div>
