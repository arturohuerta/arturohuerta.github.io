      <td><p class="tparagraph">This is my thunkable project. It was a minecraft sound board made por computer science principles. This project was mostly made to teach us some of the basics on how to 
      make an app using block. The things learned from this app were easily applicable to real coding such as being able to use variables and connect things like sounds to button and 
      other contraptions. A few of the problems I had was syncing the sound, at times they would not play or do anything really,but It was all the type of file the sound was kept in. 
      Another problem was the randomization of the sounds, in the end I fixed it with help of another student and I just really had almost all my blocks in the wrong place. But over 
      all this project really helped me figure out some new techniques in both block coding and regular coding.</p></td>
